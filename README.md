# ðŸ“· Computer vision license plate recognition

This Python project uses the CV2 computer vision library to detect and read license plates from a camera feed in real time and log the captured license plate numbers. Currently, the program is optimised for standard European license plates (e.g. ABC123, ABC12D, etc.). Please note that this project is a proof of concept and is not for production use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/svedev0/cv-license-plates
    ```
2. Install dependencies:  
Download both Tesseract-OCR and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and place them in the root directory.

Due to licensing concerns, Tesseract-OCR and the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file are not included in this repository. Please download them on your own. Google is your friend!
